#  AOSP BUILD SCRIPT  #
#                     #
#######################

# Build an AOSP ROM with one easy script! You will need to have the repo synced
# and configured already, use this page to help you with that:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanchance/Android-Tools/master/Building_AOSP.txt
#
# HINT: You can add the folder this is in to your PATH variable so you can
# run it from anywhere like so:
# $ nano ~/.bashrc
# Add  export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_folder>  to the end of that file
# then hit ctrl+X, Y, then Enter
#
# example: export PATH=$PATH:/home/<username>/scripts
# Restart your terminal

#  Necessary edits  #
#                   #
#####################

# You will need to manually edit some variables/sections based on your preferences
# (read the comments throughout the script to understand what is doing on)
# The variables SOURCEDIR and DESTDIR MUST BE FILLED OUT BEFORE RUNNING THE SCRIPT
# There are a few other sections to be edited, marked with an EDIT OPTION comment

#         #
#  Usage  #
#         #
###########

# $ bash build-rom.sh -d <device> -s -c -l

# Device is a mandatory parameter
# -d, --device          device you want to build for

# Optional Parameters:
# -s, --sync            Repo Sync Rom before building.
# -c, --clean           clean build directory before compilation
# -l, --log             perform logging of compilation
